# Optimal Control of a Flexible Robotic Link
### Group 23 - Course Project
**Course:** Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning (2025/2026)

## Project Overview
This project involves the modeling, trajectory optimization, and feedback control of a flexible robotic link. The system is modeled as a planar **double pendulum with nonlinear rotational stiffness** acting on the second joint, simulating a flexible link manipulator.

The project is divided into sequential tasks ranging from dynamics modeling to Model Predictive Control (MPC) and realistic animation.

## Repository Structure

### Source Code (`src/`)
* `dynamics.py`: Discrete-time dynamics (Forward Euler) and symbolic Jacobians using **SymPy**.
* `cost.py`: Cost function definitions (Stage cost and Terminal cost) and their gradients.
* `equilibrium.py`: Computation of equilibrium configurations $(x_{eq}, u_{eq})$.
* `reference_curve.py`: Generation of reference trajectories (Step and Trapezoidal/Smooth).
* `ltv_solver_LQR.py`: Implementation of the Time-Varying LQR solver (Riccati Equation).
* `solver_MPC.py`: Linear MPC solver implemented using **CasADi**.

### Executables
* `main_task1.py`: Trajectory generation via Newton's Method (Step Reference).
* `main_task2.py`: Trajectory generation via Newton's Method (Smooth Reference - Trapezoidal trajectory).
* `main_task3.py`: Tracking control via Time-Varying LQR (TV-LQR).
* `main_task4.py`: Tracking control via Linear Model Predictive Control (MPC).
* `main_task5.py`: Realistic animation of the system.

### Output
* `images/`: Contains all the plots generated by the tasks (States, Inputs, Errors, Animations).
* `*.npy`: Data files storing optimal trajectories (generated by Task 2, used by Tasks 3, 4, 5).

## Installation & Requirements

The project requires **Python 3.x** and the following libraries.
Note that **CasADi** is required for the MPC task.

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sympy casadi
